# About: life
This game is an artistic simulation of my personal view upon life.

The mechanics of the game are going to adjust based on your current state in that life. The game encourages you to play it multiple times to discover the current paths that are available.

## Current ideas and state
- [ ] Choose from multiple jobs.
- [ ] Gather income and improve your life situation.
- [ ] Hidden hapiness mechanic that determines how happy you are in life. It will only be indirectly visible through your 'personal thoughts'
- [ ] Happiness will impact mechanics, i.e. how hard it is to complete your job every day.
